# 20190124

We use the new data `agret_20190124` and `mvdec_201901`.

### Steps

1. preprocessing, including `%makerhs()`, `%makeRD()`, `%makeEMP()`.
2. Calculating $z$-score as before.
3. Using only the NYSE firms to find breakpoints: 10%, 20%, ... 90%.
4. Merging the breakpoints back to the data, finding the spread between the 90 above and 10 below.
