LHS data is \code{4k-obs/winsor1-portyear}

It seems that the only way to improve slope results is to limit lhs between (-1, 1). (There are some slope outliers that 1 < |slpoe| < 5 , but |retsprd| < 1 always, so this has no affect on the result of retsprd.)

We tried to limit PE sprd. It seems the lower bound should be no more than 5, and the upper bound should >= 40. This methond can adjust retsprd results, but slope dropped again. The following results are ``\code{if 5<pe<40;}''.
